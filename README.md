This is my lastest project with Angular JS.

It is a Language learning application which gives you an English word and 3 Spanish words to guess from

The main code is in services.js which has a number of factories which, Shuffle the words ready for the game and also ensures
the same English word isn't used.

Inside Routes folder is the Express.js implementation which writes the highestscores to File IO.
